Lists Basics Exercise
Now that we've learned about lists, let's get some practice. 
See the problem statements in the comments below:
"""

# Initially create an empty list called instructors

# Add the following strings to the instructors list 
    # "Colt"
    # "Blue"
    # "Lisa"

# Run the tests to make sure you've done this correctly!

instructors = []
instructors.append("Colt")
print(instructors)
instructors.append("Blue")
print(instructors)
instructors.append("Lisa")
print(instructors)
