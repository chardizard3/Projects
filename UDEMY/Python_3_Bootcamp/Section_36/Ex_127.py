'''
Write a function called is_odd_string which returns true 
if sum of each character's position in the alphabet is odd. 
For example, "a" is in the first position, "b" is in the second position, and so on. 
If the sum is even, return false.  
NOTE: INDEXING STARTS AT 1.  A is position 1, NOT POSITION 0.
